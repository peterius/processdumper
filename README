* dirty, unfinished, exploratory code for analyzing software
* Run it from an administrator console or it will quit with some unhelpful error.
* From pretty early on, I started compiling the console application 64 bit.  So while it should work on 32 bit applications, it will likely be broken if compiled for 32 bit.
* installing driver requires:

	bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON
	and reboot

	and to turn it off bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING OFF

	I think I used

	MakeCert -r -pe -ss PrivateCertStore -n "CN=test.com(test)" testcert.cer

	for the signing certificate and then set the test certificate in the driver project properties.  Pretty sure it's per-machine

	makecert-test-certificate from msdn
